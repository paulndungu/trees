    <p>Trees as far as we are concerned have no universal definition. In its broadest sense a tree is any plant with the form of an elongated stem  or trunk.</p>

        <div class="p2">
    <p>The tree growth habit follows the evolutionary(dynamic) adaptation that is found in differernt groups of plants an example being: when a tree grows much taller it is able to obtain better sunlight. There are some trees with longer lifespans tha others, some tending to reach several thousands of years.</p>

        <p>The number of trees in the world were estimated to be around 3.04 trillion. Trees are said to have different regions in which they grow. This regions include: the tropics and the temperate zones. Trees are also oftenly distributed according to the different climatic regions and also surrounding temperatures. An example includes conifers: this are most likely to be found around cool temperature regions.</p>

            <p>This is a part of the tree that acts as a sort of like anchor to the ground. It is used to gather nutrients and water from the ground and take  it to the other parts of the tree. The roots are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, storage of energy and other many things.</p>

            <p>Its main purpose is to make sure that the leaves are raised above the gound. This is what determines the height of the tree and its ability to outgrow other trees in the race to catch more sunlight.

            <p>this specialize in photosynthesis. In trees they are arranged in some format that enables them to absorb as much sunlight(maximum exposure) without having to deny the other leaves from getting light. In coniferous trees<img src="img/coniferous leaf.jpg" height="40%"width="40%">, the needles are compact but structurally similar to leaves in broad leafed plants. Leaves adapt in various ays such as thorns in areas with many predators and semi-arid regions.</p>

        <p>Trees are known to be a source of the world`s beat known fleshy fruit pruduce. Examples of this include: apples,pears and plums. Trees are also a source of palm oil which comes from the fruits of the palm oil. The maple syrup that we consume comes from sap of the sugar maple that helps in the production of maple sugar. The sugar maple is produced during climate change at the end of winter as trees prepare to burst into growth.</p>

            <p>Wood from trees has been used for years as a traditional source of fuel. It is especially used in rural areas. The practise of collecting the firewod is often considered to be time consuming in contrast to the use of gas cookers and electrical cookers. The firewood can either be used directly the way it is or can be burned in to  form charcoal. The smoke from wood can be used as preservative to keep food from being stale for long periods of time.</p>
